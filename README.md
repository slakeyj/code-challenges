This repo is a collection of code challenges I have worked on.



### Problems to do:
- Return the sum of the 2 largest integers in an array (use sort() then try to solve without using sort())
- Implement a function to find the first character in a string that only appears once. Ex: 'ABACCDEFF' should return 'B'
- Given an array determine if it contains 3 numbers whose sum equals 0.
- Rotate an array by N places.  Example:  [10,20,30,40,50] rotated 2 = [30,40,50,10,20]
- Remove duplicate characters in a string, keeping only unique occurrences. Example: 'tree traversal' => 'tre avsl'
- Given a multi-dimensional array, an xmin, an xmax, a ymin, a ymax, return the sum of the numbers in that square.

Input: (xmin=1,xmax=3,ymin=0,ymax=2)
[
  [2,4,6,7,8],
  [1,5,3,4,9]
  [8,1,3,4,2]
]
4+6+7+5+3+4+1+3+4 = 37

- Given an integer array, one element occurs an odd number of times and all of the others have even occurrences. Find the element with odd occurrences.
- Given two strings check if they're anagrams (including all characters: punctuation, capitalizion, spaces, etc.)
- Reverse words in a string (no split). " mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow" => "snow as white was fleece its, lamb little a had mary "
- Given a phone number of 7 digits, generate a list of all the words you can form with those letters. 2 = ABC, 3 = DEF, etc.  For our purposes, any combo of letters will be a word. The words must be 7 characters long.
- Right justify a number (as a string) to 10 characters. Examples:
42 => "0000000042"
123456789 => "0123456789"
542 => "0000000542"
