# Singly Linked List
- Create a Node and LinkedList class that can handle a singly linked list.

## Challenge
- insert: takes in a value and adds a new node with that value to the head
- includes: takes a value in as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists in the linked list
- toString: takes in no arguments. It returns a string representing all the values that exist in a linked list formatted as "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
- append: insert a value at the end of the linked list
- insertBefore: takes in a value and new value.  Inserts the new value before the given value
- insertAfter: takes in a value and new value. Inserts the new value after the given value.
- findKthValue: takes in value k, and, starting from the end of the linked list, finds that place in the linked list and returns the value
- removeNthFromEnd: Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
